# ðŸŽ¯ 100 Days of Code â€“ C Programming Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge in C!  
This repo documents my daily progress, learning, and projects as I sharpen my C skills and build clean, beginnerâ€‘friendly programs.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Each day has its own folder with:
- `.c` source files (wellâ€‘commented for clarity)
- **No** compiled binaries (`.exe`, `.o`, `.out`) â€” build locally to run
- Optional `README.md` for dayâ€‘specific notes
